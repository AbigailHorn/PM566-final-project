This is my PM566 Final Project website.

<br>

## Website essentials 

The minimum requirements for an R Markdown website are:

- `index.Rmd`: contains the content for the website homepage
- `_site.yml`: contains metadata for the website

<br>

### Add `_site.yml`

A basic example of a `_site.yml` file for a website with two pages:

```{r eval = FALSE}
name: "my-website"
navbar:
  title: "My Website"
  left:
    - text: "Home"
      href: index.html
```

<br>

### Add `index.Rmd`

And a basic `index.Rmd` to create the Home page:

```{r eval = FALSE}
---
title: "My Website"
---
 
Hello, Website! Welcome to the world.
```
